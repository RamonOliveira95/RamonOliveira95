- Hi, I'm Ramon. I'm 30 years old and a Mobile Developer specializing in Flutter and Dart as my primary tech stacks.

- Currently, I am a Flutter Mobile Developer. I have contributed to the development of the 'My BMW' app and completed training in Dart and Flutter through Alura, Flutterando, and the Flutter Academy. Here, I will share some of the challenges I’ve completed during my courses, as well as personal projects that have helped me grow and build my portfolio.
